            Hello, welcome to the next lesson. This is AJ from EffortlessEnglishClub.com. Let’s start our next lesson the “Attractor Factor.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Attractor Factor is the name of a book by Joe Vitale. Joe Vitale is an interesting man. He is an Internet marketer and businessman. He’s kind of a marketing expert, especially for Internet marketing. But, he also writes about very general topics, about
            how to achieve your goals and how to reach your dreams in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wrote this book The Attractor Factor as a more general book to help everybody get what they want in life, to help everybody achieve their dreams. The Attractor Factor is a quite simple book, a very simple idea and yet it’s very powerful. Joe believes that we attract things to our life. And how do we do that? With our thinking and our
emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for example, if we always think very positive thoughts and we always have very strong positive emotions, he believes we will attract positive things and positive people into our life. On the other hand, if we think about negative things, problems all the time, and we’re always feeling negative, frustrated, angry, sad or depressed, than we
will attract more negative stuff into our life. It’s the basic idea of The Attractor Factor.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, he states very strongly and clearly that we have to be careful what we focus on, what we think about and which feelings we feel during every day. Because of course, we want to attract, bring, positive things into our life, things and people and events. So, I’m going to read a little bit from The Attractor Factor and then I’ll talk
more about it. Here we go.
          </p>
          <div class="inner-bg-clr">
            <p>
              Most people I talk to every day know what they don’t want. ‘I don’t want this backache. I don’t want this headache. I don’t want these bills. I don’t want to struggle in my business.’ You know the list. You have one of your own.
              Unfortunately, that’s where most of us stop.
            </p>
            <p>
              The nature of our conversations, the nature of our newspaper reporting, the nature of our radio and television shows and our talk shows surround us with
ideas of what we don’t want.
            </p>
            <p>
              It feels good to complain. We don’t feel alone. We feel heard. We feel relieved. We feel understood. Sometimes we even get answers that make our problems easier. But, what we don’t realize is that we are activating the attractor force in a
negative way.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we say ‘I don’t want these bills’ our focus is on bills. The spirit of life will deliver whatever you focus on. So if you’re talking about your bills you’ll get more
bills. You’ll attract it by spending energy on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people live on the level of fear. As Eleanor Moody wrote, ‘Let us remember that fear is only wrongly directed faith. We are having faith in things we do not
want rather than having faith in things we desire.’
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, this is the level most people live at. It isn’t bad, it just isn’t very positive. And it probably isn’t getting you the health, wealth or happiness you want. Unfortunately, we seldom take this process to level two. It’s a rare person, it’s a special person, who will stop complaining, stop fighting and stop fearing long enough to focus on the opposite of what they are experiencing. Yet this level
brings miracles and the manifestations that we want.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing what you don’t want is the springboard to your miracles. It’s the springboard to knowing what you do want. Knowing what you don’t want is simply your current reality and current reality can be changed. So it’s important as a first step to remove negativity. One way to protect yourself from the
negative influences of the world is to abstain from them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember how Jack Canfield forbad any negativity in his office. I love the idea.
I don’t watch the news or read the newspapers. Because after a while, you begin to see how you are given only one-sided, very negative news. None of the news
is designed to help your well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              But you also have to watch your friends. The people around you will share their views of the world with you. And sometimes it’s not easy to separate their views from your view.
If your friends are very negative you must be very, very careful.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Okay, that’s the end of the section from The Attractor Factor by Joe Vitale.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so, he’s really just talking about negative thinking, negative focus and Joe Vitale and many others talk about this same very basic idea. You get what you focus on. If you focus on problems you get more problems. If you focus on being poor you stay poor.
If you focus on not having enough money, you continue not to have enough
money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking can create reality is the idea. What you focus on becomes real and stays real. So he’s saying if you focus on negative things you get more of those negative
things. So what’s important is to change from negative focus to positive focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, don’t focus on being fat. You say oh, I’m fat. I don’t want to be fat. I don’t want to be fat. I don’t want to be fat. You will attract more fatness. You’ll stay fat. Why? Because you’re focused on fat and you’re focused on being fat, but you
have to change that a little bit and make it a positive focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, you say I want to be strong, healthy and thin. It’s a small change that’s really easy to do, but it will make a big difference. So, you start focusing all your mental energy on being strong, healthy, thin; strong, healthy, thin; strong, healthy, thin and that’s what you focus on. As you focus every day, every moment, every hour, every minute on being strong, healthy and thin you will attract strength, happiness and
thinness into your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, your brain will start to find solutions. Your brain will take the appropriate actions to get what you are focusing on. So be very careful about this. It’s okay as a first step; step one decide what do you not want. What are you sick of in your life? That’s fine. You can say I’m sick of being bad at English.
I’m sick of being
a terrible speaker. That’s okay that’s step one, but you have to go to step two, to level
two and that is decide what you do want.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s the positive thing you want that’s what you have to focus on all the time? So you decide, I will speak excellent English. And every minute, in every day, in every month, in every year you focus on the positive thing.
I will speak excellent English. I
will speak excellent English.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don’t think about the problems. You don’t think about the mistakes. You don’t think about the negative bad thing that you don’t want. You focus on the positive thing
that you do want.
          </p>
          <p>
            And you know it’s easy to fall into the negative thinking. I do it too. With the business sometimes, I’ll think oh we’re having problems. We don’t have enough sales this week. And then, I’m thinking all week, we don’t have enough sales, we don’t have enough sales, we don’t have enough sales and that’s what I’m focusing on. What
happens? We continue to have low sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have to, you know, smack myself in the face and jump around, do something to break my negative thinking and I focus then on the positive. We will have great sales this week. We will have great sales every month. Our sales are increasing and I think
about that again and again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actually made a little picture and I put it on the wall with our sales goal. We will have this many sales every week. And I look at that and I remind myself of the positive goal, the positive thing. And so, you know, our business does get better. I’m focused
on solutions. I’m focused on the positive not just complaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, that’s the basic idea very, very simple, but it can make a very big change in your life if you do it constantly, all the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            So good luck, please do this. Take your negative complaining beliefs and ideas and statements and change them into positive statements, what you do want. And then every day focus on those things that you do want. You will bring those things to you, just by focusing on them. You don’t have to do anything else, just by focusing on them
every day all the time they will come to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is the end of The Attractor Factor by Joe Vitale.
